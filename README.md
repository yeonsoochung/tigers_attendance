# Predicting the Detroit Tigers' Home Game Attendances
Here I discuss my first personal data science project in which I predict the Detroit Tigers home attendance numbers for the 2018 and 2019 seasons by training on data from the 2013-2017 seasons and inputting 2018-2019 test data to machine learning (ML) models. This repo contains the code I wrote to collect/wrangle the data and to run the ML models for this project. This project topic was selected based on some personal interest in the sport and suitability with my current skill level.

Predictions were made with multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression models. Upon comparison with actual 2018-2019 home attendance data, it was found that the multiple linear regression model yielded the best results.
