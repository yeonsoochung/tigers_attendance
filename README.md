# Predicting the Detroit Tigers' Home Game Attendances
Here I discuss my first personal data science project in which I predict the Detroit Tigers home attendance numbers for the 2018 and 2019 seasons by training on data from the 2013-2017 seasons and inputting 2018-2019 test data to machine learning (ML) models. This repo contains the code I wrote to collect/wrangle the data and to run the ML models for this project.
