# Predicting Detroit Tigers Home Game Attendances
I describe my first personal data science project in which I predict the Detroit Tigers home attendance numbers for the 2018 and 2019 seasons by training on data from the 2013-2017 seasons and inputting 2018-2019 test data to ML models. This repo contains the code I wrote to collect/wrangle the data and to run the machine learning models for this project.
